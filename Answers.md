1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
.forEach goes through each attributes


2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

A function is a function that is declared either in a function scope(local scope) or global scope. A method is a separate function that is declared within an object.

3. What is closure?

A closure is a variable within a function scope that is saved throughout the child functions so they can call upon it.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
Implicit:
Explicit:
Window:
call: 


5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

Super basically brings all the parent attributes and methods into the child and allows child to have it's own attributes and methods. It is basically the replacement for .call(). Binds the this keyword.
